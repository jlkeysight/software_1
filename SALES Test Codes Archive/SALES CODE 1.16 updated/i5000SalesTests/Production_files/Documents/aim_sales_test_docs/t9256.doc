   DC SOURCE VOLTAGE HEADROOM TEST

   Purpose:

   These tests measures the ability of the DC source to produce a voltage
   greater than the specified maximum voltage with no load.

   Tests:    9256 DC SOURCE VOLTAGE HEADROOM TEST

   Theory:

   The test sets up to verify that the DC source will produce a voltage
   greater than specification at the end of it's range.  The test uses both 
   negative and positive source voltage.  This test connects the
   DC Source output to the sales rack DMM via Calib 1 and ground via
   Calib 2.  The actual voltage is measured at the DMM for each value.
   Maximum positive voltage is obtained by writing decimal 4095 (0FFF Hex)
   to the offset DAC of the source.  Decimal 0 (0000 Hex) causes maximum
   negative offset voltage to be produced.  Results returned represent
   intermediate values as follows:
       1st log result:	 >10v actual value  (high current range)
       2nd log result:	 <-10v actual value  (high current range)
       3rd log result:	 >10v actual value  (low current range)
       4th log result:	 <-10v actual value  (low current range)
