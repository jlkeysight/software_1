   DC SOURCE VOLTAGE ACCURACY

   Purpose:

   These tests measures the absolute accuracy of the DC source voltage
   circuitry with no load.

   Tests:    9255 DC SOURCE VOLTAGE TEST

   Theory:

   The test sets up to verify that the DC source will produce a voltage
   within specification over it's entire range.  The test uses both 
   negative and positive source voltage and checks both the low range
   (up to 0.1v) and the high range (up to 10v).  This test connects the
   DC Source output to the sales rack DMM via Calib 1 and ground via
   Calib 2.  The actual voltage is measured at the DMM for each value.
   Results returned represent intermediate values as follows:
       1st log result:	-10v actual value  (high range)
       1st nolog result:	-10v source range bit 
       2nd log result:	- 5v actual value  (high range)
       2nd nolog result:	- 5v source range bit 
       3rd log result:	-.2v actual value  (high range)
       3rd nolog result:	-.2v source range bit 
       4th log result:	-.1v actual value  (low range)
       4th nolog result:	-.1v source range bit 
       5th log result:	  0v actual value  (low range)
       5th nolog result:	  0v source range bit 
       6th log result:	 .1v actual value  (low range)
       6th nolog result:	 .1v source range bit 
       7th log result:	 .2v actual value  (high range)
       7th nolog result:	 .2v source range bit 
       8th log result:	  5v actual value  (high range)
       8th nolog result:	  5v source range bit 
       9th log result:	 10v actual value  (high range)
       9th nolog result:	 10v source range bit 
       10th logged value:        -10v source range bit
       11th logged value:        - 5v source range bit
       12th logged value:        -.2v source range bit
       13th logged value:        -.1v source range bit
       14th logged value:          0v source range bit
       15th logged value:         .1v source range bit
       16th logged value:         .2v source range bit
       17th logged value:          5v source range bit
       18th logged value:         10v source range bit
   Specs for this test are logged against the 0.1% +/- 5mV (for high range)
   and 0.1% +/- 300uV (for low range).  These limits more than compensate
   for measurement uncertainty of the dmm (3458A) and the cabling losses.
